                -- Moonbot --
An IRC bot made in Lua. To start, make sure you
have Lua >= 5.2 and LuaIRC installed. You can
install LuaIRC through the dev server of LuaRocks:

  # luarocks install --server=https://luarocks.org/dev luairc

Make sure the bot is configured; change the
'server' and 'chan' values according to what
IRC server and channel you want the bot to listen
on. Then to start the bot, run make:

  $ make

For help on bot usage, consult HELP, or run --help.
